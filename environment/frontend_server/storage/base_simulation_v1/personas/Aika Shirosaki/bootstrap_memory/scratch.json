Despite her timid nature, Aika is deeply kind and thoughtful, always noticing the little things about people that others overlook. She yearns to break out of her shell but fears rejection, relying on the safety of familiar faces. Though she may appear fragile, there’s an inner strength within her waiting to be discovered—she just needs the right push.",
