With a laid-back demeanor, he’s quick to smile and even quicker to laugh, never taking life too seriously. Beneath his easygoing nature, though, is someone deeply romantic, who craves genuine connection. He’s thoughtful and has a quiet confidence, rarely feeling the need to prove himself. Noah loves to embrace the fun of a summer fling, though there’s also a part of him that hopes for something more meaningful, something that lasts beyond the season.",
