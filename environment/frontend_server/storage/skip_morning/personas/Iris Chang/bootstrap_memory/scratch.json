While she\u2019s used to being overlooked, she\u2019s far from resentful\u2014 the twins love and support each other and Iris prefers the peace that comes with solitude. Thoughtful and introspective, Iris finds comfort in books, logic, and structured plans, often immersing herself in her studies to avoid the chaotic energy her sister thrives in. However, deep down, she longs to be noticed for who she truly is, not just as \u201cMina\u2019s twin.\u201d Though she rarely seeks attention, when she does speak, her words carry weight\u2014she\u2019s insightful, sharp, and capable of surprising those who underestimate her. While she doesn\u2019t need the spotlight, she yearns for someone who genuinely sees her and appreciates the quiet strength she possesses.",
