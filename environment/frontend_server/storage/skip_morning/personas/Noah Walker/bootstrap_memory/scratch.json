  "learned": "Noah has an infectious energy, always living in the moment and enjoying life to the fullest. He\u2019s spontaneous and has a natural ability to make anyone around him feel at ease. With a laid-back demeanor, he\u2019s quick to smile and even quicker to laugh, never taking life too seriously. Beneath his easygoing nature, though, is someone deeply romantic, who craves genuine connection. He\u2019s thoughtful and has a quiet confidence, rarely feeling the need to prove himself. Noah loves to embrace the fun of a summer fling, though there\u2019s also a part of him that hopes for something more meaningful, something that lasts beyond the season.",

Noah recognizes quickly that all the ladies on campus want to spend time with him and have a sexual relationship with him. They are even willing to share him, allowing Noah to fulfill the male fantasy of forming a harem of girls.",
