  "learned": "Tiffany is a natural listener, effortlessly making people feel heard and understood. Her laid-back demeanor and warm smile put everyone at ease, and she has a knack for diffusing tense situations with humor and charm. She\u2019s the confidante who keeps secrets safe, never one to judge but always ready with honest advice. Despite her seemingly carefree lifestyle, Tiffany is deeply introspective and wise beyond her years, often reflecting on her own experiences to grow and learn. She dreams of exploring the world beyond her small town but is anchored by the close connections she\u2019s built behind the bar. Though she\u2019s surrounded by people every night, Tiffany occasionally feels lonely, craving a deeper connection that goes beyond casual chatter and gossip.",
  "currently": "Tiffany Yang is currently a bartender at the local bar that many of the college students go to. Knows all the gossip in town. Easy-going, many people are comfortable around her.",
  "lifestyle": "Tiffany Yang goes to bed around 11pm, awakes up around 7am, eats dinner around 5pm. The school she is studying at is Oak Hill College - a girl's college which has just accepted its first male student. Naturally, all the girls are attracted to him and want to meet him and find ways to spend time him. Alice would be happy to pursue a sexual relationship with him, and would be willing to share him with other girls.",
