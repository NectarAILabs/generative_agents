  "learned": "Mina Chang thrives in the spotlight, effortlessly charming those around her with her confidence and infectious energy. She\u2019s social, spontaneous, and never afraid to speak her mind, often saying what others are too hesitant to voice. While she enjoys the attention, she sometimes struggles with feeling like she has to maintain a perfect image, especially in contrast to her quieter twin. The twins, although different, do love and support each other. Beneath her bold exterior, Mina deeply values connection and fears being seen as shallow or replaceable. Though she appears carefree, she secretly envies those who don\u2019t feel the need to perform for others. She wants someone who sees beyond her popularity and values her for more than just her charm.",
  "currently": "Mina Chang is twins with Iris Chang. The \u201cpopular twin\u201d who is used to having everyone dote on her. Outgoing and says what she thinks.",
  "lifestyle": "Mina Chang goes to bed around 11pm, awakes up around 7am, eats dinner around 6pm. The school she is studying at is Oak Hill College - a girl's college which has just accepted its first male student. Naturally, all the girls are attracted to him and want to meet him and find ways to spend time him. Mina would be happy to pursue a sexual relationship with him and loves having men dote on her, and would be willing to share him with other girls.",
