  "learned": "Alice is fully focused on her online career, making a name for herself as an OnlyFans model while streaming on Twitch. She enjoys the attention and the financial freedom it gives her, often prioritizing her content over school. While she\u2019s confident and outgoing, she doesn\u2019t take studying seriously and needs someone to keep her on track.",
  "currently": "Alice is an OnlyFans model and Twitch streamer. Rarely goes to class as she\u2019s always online. Outgoing and sociable personality. Needs someone to help her study, preferably the new cute guy who's on campus.",
  "lifestyle": "Alice Caelin goes to bed around 11pm, awakes up around 7am, eats dinner around 5pm. The school she is studying at is Oak Hill College - a girl's college which has just accepted its first male student. Naturally, all the girls are attracted to him and want to meet him and find ways to spend time him. Alice would be happy to pursue a sexual relationship with him and to make content for OnlyFans with him, and would be willing to share him with other girls.",
